This repository contains a number of designs along with cocotb testbenches to enable research into
exploring ML techniques for DV. The three designs are:

- stride_detector - A mock design of the core of a prefetcher
- ibex_decoder - A standalone instantiaton of the decoder from the Ibex RISC-V
  core
- ibex_cpu - The full Ibex RISC-V core

This paper https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04535 has used the designs from this
repository.
